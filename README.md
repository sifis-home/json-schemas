# json-schemas
A collection of JSON schemas defined within SIFIS-Home

The `data` folder contains a JSON instance of the defined json schemas.

Schemas can be validated by using the tool [`check-jsonschema`](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A GitHub Action takes care of validating the schemas against the JSON instances in the `data` folder.

Meanwhile, you can find the description of the API Label and App Label schemas in deliverable D2.4.

NOTE: The API label and the app label schemas were previously hosted at the [wp2-documents](https://github.com/sifis-home/wp2-documents/tree/master/wp2-deliverable-2.2/schemas) repository.
