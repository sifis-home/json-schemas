# json-schemas
A collection of json schemas defined within SIFIS-Home

The `data` folder contains an json instance of the defined json schemas.

Schemas can be validated by using the tool [`check-jsonschema`](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
This validation will be included in the CI.

Meanwhile, you can find the description of the API Label and App Label schemas in deliverable D2.4.
The API label and the app label schemas were previously hosted at the [wp2-documents](https://github.com/sifis-home/wp2-documents/tree/master/wp2-deliverable-2.2/schemas) repository.
