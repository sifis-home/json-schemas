# json-schemas
A collection of JSON schemas defined within SIFIS-Home

The `data` folder contains a JSON instance of the defined json schemas.

Schemas can be validated by using the tool [`check-jsonschema`](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A GitHub Action takes care of validating the schemas against the JSON instances in the `data` folder.
